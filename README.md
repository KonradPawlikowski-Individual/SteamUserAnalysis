# SteamUserAnalysis
Simple analysis of a steam user and the relation between their achievement completion ratio and time spent playing a game.
This project calls an api asynchronously to get the required data, creates an informative visualisation, and explores the results therein.

# Further Analysis
A potential bias was found in the dataset, development budget, to account for this either direct budgets could be scraped from online sources or the games sell-price on steam could be used as an indicator of budget, since AAA games tend to cost around £40-60 while indie games cost around £10-£20

A regression of time spent on achievement completion ratio could be performed to solidify results

A games average achievement completion ratio could be used to de-bias games where achievements are harder to obtain than others, this would also give more meaning to using an individuals achievement completion ratio rather than a games achievement completion ratio.
